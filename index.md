Hi! I'm Chun Chi, better known as Mickey or q834 on the internet. I'm currently 17, a senior in [SCIE](https://www.scie.com.cn), and looking to pursue undergraduate studies abroad from China.

## About ~~Me~~ Mathematics
I like Mathematics. Like alot. I've self-learned topics in higher mathematics from calculus and analysis to geometry and algebra. My favorite is abstract algebra, especially algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. I'm especially interested in the connection between number fields with unique factorization and j-invariants. (I'm not making promises anymore but I hope to eventually make a video about this on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@q834maths).)

I'm looking to explore more fields of mathematics, such as Measure Theory, Topology, and Class Field Theory before I graduate from high school. In my future studies I will be pursuing Pure Mathematics, likely something Abstract Algebra related.

I also like to teach Mathematics. Please contact me for help.
